<p>  Global Waring and fossil fuels are results of carbon footprint,About three-quarters of greenhouse gas emissions that are attributed to humans come from burning fossil fuels. We burn fossil fuels — non-renewable energy sources — when we operate vehicles, heat our homes, and even use electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The Administration has also concluded that greenhouse gas emissions have been on the rise since industrialization, suggesting that humans are to blame for much of the greenhouse gas production.

But do factor in the greenhouse gas emissions from the production of the car as well as its operation. Some electric vehicles are initially responsible for more emissions than internal combustion engine

       <p  style="font-size:30px">After looking at the previous solutions and seeing that they are mostly dependent on stopping a set of lifestyle methods, such as stopping eating a lot of meat, disconnecting electrical appliances when stopping their need, and so on, we thought that it would be good to think of something more creative, which is to supply the places that emit greenhouse gases in abundance, such as exhaust Cars and factory chimneys with a filtration system so that smoke comes out, faces the filtration device, and then it comes out clean to the environment.<br><br>
        In other places, we can make a device that collects these greenhouse gases so that scientists can use them in doing their experiments, for example. And then take them and add them to components to create new and useful compounds<br> <br>
        This solution is useful in all respects, so the environment will be preserved, as well as the human being benefited from it, and this device must be provided with certain materials to attract these gases to it, so scientists should take this issue seriously. As for the filtration system, it is preferred to be made from good materials that are resistant to these gases so that it will remain for the longest possible period.
